After designing you GUI in the QtDesigner, if you hit the View Code item in the form menu will come up with this Error:

""""Unable to launch /usr/lib/qt5/bin/uic.""""



I searched online alot and I could'n find why is that there.  As you can find in this video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmo8eZG5I2w&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdVpDFNq4FwY9APZPGSUyR4&index=16 the instructor says that I don't know what is this error for.
More information you can find in this page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13792502/unable-to-launch-qt-uic



But there is no problems even with that error out there. when you install PyQt5, a useful tool will be installed. called 'pyuic'.



Using this tool in command line you can convert the output of the QtDesigner (just save .ui file) to beautiful python code.


pyuic5 untitled.ui -o untitled.py
pyuic5 -x hello.ui -o test.py  --> this will add a bunch of extra codes to the python file that you can execute the python script
pyuic5 -p hello.ui  --> using this you can preview the GUI. No python files will be generated



You can find very useful documentation of pyuic in the link below:
