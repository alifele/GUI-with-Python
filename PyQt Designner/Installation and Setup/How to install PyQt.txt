Welcome to the World of Cool GUIs.

Since I learned how to program I was very interested in building GUIs.
The first time I started to make my own gui I used python and tkinter library. That was very cool. and ofcourse very hard. 
Then I found some cool software like programms like page that with use of that you could simply desing the layout.


After searching alot about the GUI packaged I found Qt by far better than librariers. Qt and its software Qt Creator was originally desinged 
to make GUIs with C++ (some day I will go toward that)

The video in this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBME1ZyHiP8&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdVpDFNq4FwY9APZPGSUyR4&index=1 
provides way the best way to simply install the PyQt


But the good news is that you can use the Qt with PyQt. There are many versions out there that the last one is PyQt5.
In the following article you can find how to install the PyQt and make a very simple GUI with it

Of course you can find tons of information in this video series on you tube:
