In this code I costumized the Code Generated by page to be used in my own program.


The very usefull part of the code generated by page is the placments.
So the only part that you will need is this part.


open a new python file and write the following code:

'''
import tkinter as tk



if __name__ == "__main__":
	app = simple_GUI()
	app.mainloop()


'''

then now you need to add the class which controls the GUI.
to do this creat the following class:


'''
class simple_GUI(tk.Tk):
	def __init__(self):
		super().__init__()  # this will initialize the class which is passed to the simple_GUI class argument. In this way you
				    # will have access to the 'self' of the Tk class. For seeing the alternative please see the end of this
				    # artice

		%Copy the class codes here%

		%Copy the class codes here%

		%Copy the class codes here%


				   # since we have :   def __init__(self, top=None), so replace all the 'top's with 'self'
				   # this is because the page uses the altenative of using the super() function. (see end of the 
				   # article to see this alternative)



####################### Alternative of using super() function ############################

class simple_GUI:

	def __init__(self, master):
		self.master = master

	.
	.
	.	



if __name__ == "__main__":
	
	root = tk.Tk()
	app = simple_GUI(root)
	app.mainloop()
